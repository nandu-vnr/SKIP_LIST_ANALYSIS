Note: We have executed the python program in Visual Studio Code with python 3.12 version on a Windows machine

Step 1: Install the python packages below
	a. random
	b. math
	c.numpy
	d. plotly
	e. time
	f.statistics
	g.pandas
	h.timeit
	i.matplotlib

code for installing

--> pip install numpy
--> pip install plotly
--> pip install pandas
--> pip install matplotlib


Step 2: We have executed the python progam using juyter notebook, most of the code implementation 
	may look similar but with different outputs.All the blocks of code can be executed directly
	without any input. The code block which calculates the number of comparisions made for each
	operation (search, insert, delete) the size limit is set to 4500 due to system limitations.
	If there are any issues with this size it can be changed accordingly in the measure_runtime method 

Step 3: All the graphs are interactive with hovering effects applied and the GRAPH LINEAGE can be changed by
	clicking on the colours shown for the parameters, most of the parameters are overlapped, in order to view it,
	click on the the colours for the parameters shown at top right can remove it from the graph there by it shows overlapped parameters


Step 4: We have also made the comparisions for AVL tree which takes more than 1 min and 30 sec to execute
